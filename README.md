- **Code contribution:** *what to put here?*

    Please link a pull request, ideally submitted to your chosen project or one of the NIU tools. Applications without a code contribution won't be considered. It must be publicly visible and represent your own work, although you may have help from other developers in the community to further improve it. It must be meaningful code contribution (i.e. not just fixing a minor spelling mistake). While AI tools (such as Copilot etc) can be a very useful, contributions mostly created by AI are unlikely to be useful, and will not be accepted. You can link more than one pull request if desired.

## Project proposal 

**Synopsis**

We envision OCTRON as an extension of the ethology project within the NIU GSoC initiative. We propose it as an alternative to existing markerless tracking algorithms, particularly key point tracking algorithms (DLC, SLEAP, â€¦ ). OCTRON facilitates markerless segmentation for custom training dataset generation and subsequent training of custom models, enabling segmentation and tracking of objects across video frames.In the future, we aim for OCTRON's output to be compatible with the movement package, allowing anchor point tracking methods to be used alongside segmentation data generated by OCTRON. OCTRON is in the early stages of development. While we have a working version, several improvements are needed to make it a maintainable and usable open-source community contribution. These improvements include code maintainability, documentation, and further development of core OCTRON functions.

**Implementation timeline**

*   **Total Duration:** 10 weeks (~90h small project size)
*   **Estimated Weekly Hours:** 8-10 hours/week 

**Minimal Deliverables:**

*  Code maintainability
    *  Structure of the repository and organization of the codebase.
    *  Code testing (code coverage, etc.).
    *  Contribution guidelines and onboarding for new contributors.
*  Documentation
    * Complete code documentation website, for example hosted on GitHub via MkDocs.
*  Further development of core OCTRON functions, which could include:
    * Utilities for curating OCTRON output, such as stitching/merging tracks that have been artificially separated (high priority).
    * Analysis video generation and other useful features for processing OCTRON outputs (medium priority).
    * Integration of key point tracking into YOLO training (medium priority).
    * Integration of OCTRON with existing tools in the NIU codebase, like movement (see introduction above) (high priority).

A detailed **weekly timeline**: when do you plan to do what? 

        - Please use a week as a minimal unit of time, and include any planned vacations or other commitments. 
        - This timeline could be formatted as a table. 
        - Remember to also include the number of hours per week you plan to work on the GSoC project. 
        - When estimating the required time for a task, keep in mind deliverables should include investigation/research, coding and documentation. 
        - The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks - see the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates. 
        - Also please specify any prep work you plan to do during the "Community bonding period".
        - Usually week 1's deliverables already include some code. Week 6 marks the mid-term point, where usually more than half of the project should be completed. At the end of week 11 you may want to try to "freeze" the code and complete any remaining tests or documentation in weeks 11 and 12.

- **Communication plan**

    Please explain: how do you plan to communicate with your mentor? How often? (e.g., daily or weekly stand-ups, longer meetings..?) What communication channels will you use? (e.g., video calls, Zulip chat...?)
